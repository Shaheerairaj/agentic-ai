# Agentic AI – Fundamentals

**Welcome to the Agentic AI learning resource!**
Built in collaboration with [SuperDataScience](https://community.superdatascience.com), this course is part of our community-driven effort to make Agentic AI accessible to everyone.

This repository is your hands-on guide to building **AI agents from scratch using pure Python** before we move on to frameworks like LangChain or CrewAI. By the end of these courses, you’ll understand how agents work under the hood and be able to build autonomous Agentic AI systems and deploy them to production for scalability.

## About This Repository

This repository contains **step-by-step Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks** that introduce you to the core ideas of Agentic AI. You’ll build agents incrementally, starting from a simple loop around an LLM, and progressing toward agents with **tools, reasoning traces, and error handling**.

### What You'll Learn

* **What AI agents are** and how they differ from plain LLMs
* Building a **basic agent loop in Python**
* Adding **tools** (calculator, search, APIs) to agents
* Handling **errors and retries**
* A **mini project**: An AI Travel Planner

## 🚀 Getting Started

To set up your environment, please follow the step-by-step instructions for your operating system:

- **Windows:** [setup/SETUP-PC.md](setup/SETUP-PC.md)
- **Mac/Linux:** [setup/SETUP-mac.md](setup/SETUP-mac.md)

These guides cover prerequisites, repo cloning, environment setup, API key configuration, and troubleshooting tips.

Once your environment is ready, you can start learning by launching the notebooks in the `Part1-Fundamentals/` folder.
